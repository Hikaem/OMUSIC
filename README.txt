It is the code of the website that I realized with one of my classmate, as an end-of-year project.
The goal was to create a dynamic website, with a theme imposed by our teacher, so we had received as a theme, a store selling musical instrument.

We has decide to call it "O'MUSIC".
PHP was totally new for me and my classmate, so without a minute we had start to learn and code our website.
And there is the result of one month and half of code.
